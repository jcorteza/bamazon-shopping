#Bamazon Shopping CLI E-Commerce Experience
This, Node.js program coded in Javascript, is supposed to imitate the e-commerce experience but through a command line interface. Customers can "shop," and managers and supervisors can update the product stock and add new items.

##Customer Experience
The customer experience begins with the terminal command `node bamazonCustomer.js` 

From there a customer can view items available for purchase and is prompted to enter the ID and quantity of a product they would like to purchase.

The customer experience ends with a "successful purchase" message and total for the purchase. From there the customer is prompted to keep shopping (y) or quit the program (n).
